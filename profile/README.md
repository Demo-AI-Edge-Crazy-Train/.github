## Abstract

Message to Ethan Hunt: *“The train is running mad at full speed and has no driver ! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to train and deploy an AI model at the edge that recognizes traffic signs in order to stop the train before it crashes. This message will self-destruct in five seconds. Four. three. Two. one.  tam tam tada tum tum tada tum tum tada tum tum tada tiduduuuuummmm tiduduuuuuuuuummm”*.
